# UniFi Site Manager API

## Setup
- Create `config.json` next to this file (gitignored). Start from `config.json.example`.
- This skill currently uses the **Site Manager API** (infrastructure/aggregates). It does not provide per-client tracking unless extended with the local Network API.

## Commands
- `python3 scripts/unifi.py list-hosts`
- `python3 scripts/unifi.py list-sites`
- `python3 scripts/unifi.py list-devices`
- `python3 scripts/unifi.py list-aps`
- Add `--json` for raw output.
